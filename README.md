# caccl-deploy

This package tries to provide a simple (yet opinionated) method of deploying
CACCL apps to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).

### Requirements

- nodejs â‰¥ v10
- a nodejs/react app built using the CACCL library
- one of the following:
  - docker installed locally if you want `caccl-deploy` to build the image for you
  - an existing docker image of the app
- an AWS Certificate Manager certificate, preferably one that matches a hostname you have
  in mind for the app.
- an AWS account with create/update privileges for the following services and/or resources:
  - VPC
  - Elastic Load Balancer
  - ECS
  - IAM Role
  - Cloudwatch Log Group
  - Cloudformation

### Running as an installed package

- `npm run deploy` - executes a deployment if a `deployConfig.js` exists in the default location
  (`${PWD}/config/deployConfig.js`), otherwise will walk through creating one
- `npm run deploy config` - creates or updates the deploy configuration
- `npm run deploy diff` - shows changes that will be applied by a deploy
- `npm run deploy list` - will out put the name of the deployment stack; useful as a sanity check

### Running standalone

- `node index.js [-c path to deploy config] [cdk command]`

### `deployConfig.js`
